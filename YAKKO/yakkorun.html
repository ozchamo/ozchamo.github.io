<span class="yakkostage"> YAKKO: Yet Another KVM Konfigurator for Openshift</span>
<span class="yakkostage">__________________________________________________________________________</span>


<span class="yakkostage">__________________________________________________________________________</span>

<span class="yakkostage">STAGE 1: Gather Cluster Configuration information (Time start: 15:58pm)</span>

This section will gather relevant information to build an OpenShift cluster on this host.
Questions are separated by '----'. Default options are in [brackets], press enter to accept them.

----</span>
Enter the name of the OpenShift cluster to create [&quot;test&quot;]: 

----</span>
Enter the DOMAIN name to setup your cluster under [&quot;home&quot;]: 

----</span>
It is recommended that this host have a fixed IP address and a resolvable hostname.
Enter the IP address of this host on your network [&quot;192.168.100.2&quot;]: 

----</span>
Enter the SUBNET (/24) inside KVM that you want cluster under [&quot;192.168.140&quot;]: 

----</span>
YAKKO uses HAproxy to loadbalance access to OpenShift nodes, while also allowing
or restricting access to either THIS host only, or clients in your local network.
(You can change this later using 'yakko infra changeaccess')
Allow 'open' cluster access from other clients (other than this server) (Y/N) [Y]? 

----</span>
What release version do you want to install:
    1) Latest release available (4.8.4)
    2) Releases on disk
        - 4.8.2
        - 4.8.3
        - 4.8.4
    3) Older releases (hard! you will need to pick image version and installer version) 
    4) Latest release candidate (good luck!)
    5) Latest pre-release nightly (unknown territory...)
Pick option number from above (1-5) [1]: 

----</span>
Enter the directory where you wish to place the OCP VM disks for this cluster [&quot;/mnt/VMs&quot;]: /mnt/VMs/desktops/fedora-RedHat.qcow2 not reset as customized by admin to system_u:object_r:svirt_image_t:s0:c397,c766
Changing permissions for [/mnt/VMs] and all paths above.
All members of the tree need to have read/exec access so that user 'qemu' can run VMs in the destination.

----</span>
How many MASTER nodes do you want to configure (1 or 3) [3]: 

----</span>
How much RAM (MiB) should be allocated to MASTER nodes [16000]: 

----</span>
Worker nodes can be built at cluster creation or later.
To build a cluster with ONLY schedulable MASTER node(s), type '0'
How many worker nodes do you want to configure at cluster build time [2]: 

----</span>
How much RAM (MiB) should be allocated to WORKER nodes [5000]: 

----</span>
Requested OpenShift configuration requires:
- RAM:  50000 MiB 
- DISK: 150 GiB 
Accept this configuration for cluster build (Y/N) [Y]? 

----</span>
Attempt AUTOMATIC creation of cluster &quot;test&quot; (Y/N) [Y]? 

----</span>
Although YAKKO automates OpenShift cluster creation, you may want to customise the 
'install-config.yaml' configuration file before cluster bootstrap, for example,
when wanting to add a proxy server for indirect connection to the internet.
Pause for edit of 'install-config.yaml' when file becomes available (Y/N) [N]?
